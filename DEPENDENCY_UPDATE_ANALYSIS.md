## ⚠️ DEPENDENCY COMPATIBILITY WARNINGS

### react-mosaic-component Compatibility:
- The `react-mosaic-component@6.1.1` package has peer dependency warnings with React 19
- The package uses `react-dnd-multi-backend` which expects React ^16.14.0 || ^17.0.2 || ^18.0.0
- **Impact**: Warnings during install, but functionality appears to work correctly
- **Recommendation**: Monitor for potential runtime issues, consider updating if newer version becomes available

## 🚫 DEPENDENCIES TO AVOID UPDATING

### Deprecated Dependencies:
- `i@0.3.7` - This package is deprecated and should be **removed** rather than updated
- **Recommendation**: Replace with alternative or remove if unused

## 📋 FINAL UPDATE RECOMMENDATIONS

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^19.1.1",

    "vite": "^7.1.4"
  }
}
```

### Build Verification:
- ✅ All updates tested and build successfully
- ✅ No new security vulnerabilities introduced
- ✅ Bundle size remains reasonable
- ✅ No breaking changes detected

### Warnings to Monitor:
- Peer dependency warnings for react-mosaic-component (functional but not officially supported)
- Consider removing deprecated 'i' package in future cleanup

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

**All major framework updates (React 19, Vite 7) are safe to implement immediately.**

The project can benefit from:
1. Modern React 19 features and performance improvements
2. Latest Vite build optimizations
3. Up-to-date security patches
4. Better TypeScript support with updated type definitions

No breaking changes were detected during testing, making this a low-risk, high-benefit update.
